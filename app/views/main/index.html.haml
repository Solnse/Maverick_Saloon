      %h1 Maverick Saloon, Santa Ynez â€“ California
      %p 
        The Maverick Saloon, established in 1963, is one of the last original, thriving California saloons. |
        Tucked away in the heart of the Santa Ynez Valley, the Maverick gives locals and visitors a taste of |
        the Old West and makes everyone feel at home. The minute you step on the front porch you will see the |
        history in the walls constructed from old barns, hear the live music coming from the stage, and feel 
        the spirit of the people who've been welcomed through its doors by the signed dollar bills left on the |
        ceiling - proof they were once lucky enough to have been there! Next time you're in the Santa Ynez Valley |
        come by the Maverick Saloon for a beer and perhaps a line dance, and become a part of our history.
